<h1>Welcome to the collaboration webpage between the <a href="http://www.tumulkinbelize.org/">Tumul Kâ€™in Center of Learning</a> and the <a href="https://wellsscholars.indiana.edu/">Indiana University Wells Scholars</a>!</h1> 

<p>This webpage is a more simpler version of the main website: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/iutk">https://sites.google.com/view/iutk</a>. Both sites contain the same content. The difference is that the Google Site is easier to edit, but its formatting may cause it to take too long to load with the internet at Tumul K'in. So, this Github page will serve as a backup in case the Google Site is inaccessible.</p>

<p>This webpage is currently under construction! We hope to add more information, including how to edit this page, soon.</p>
